Remake of a former project that utilizes the Steam/ Valve corp API.


## Overview

"Do you even Steam" is an app that allows users to compare their game stats with other users and compete for top rank in the leader-boards.

### Version 1 target goals (MVP):

- Allow users to sign in using passport so they can connect their steam accounts directly.
- Allow users to check and compare stats without sign in.
- Populate a list of the user's top-played games.
- Populate list of random facts about the user's play time.
- Create a functional leaderboard to show all-time highs.
